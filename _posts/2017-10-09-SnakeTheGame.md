#### About the game
is one of the most classic and popular casual games in the world, this site is a humble tribute to this amazing game.

#### History of the game?
The game evolved during the mid of 1970's and was widely played as an arcade game. Due to its simple graphics and easy interface, this game attracted both entry level and professional game players because the game catered the needs of players with various skill levels.
The main interesting feature of the game is that the snake is always on the move once the game is started. The player can only control the movement of the snake but can't stop it from moving.
Due to this fact, a player needed to pay constant attention throughout the game which brought the game more popularity. Once the popularity increased, Trefonas, a US manufacturer of microcomputer games introduced a microcomputer version of snake during 1978.
The game was played on a microcomputer called TRS-80 and received a warm welcome among game enthusiasts who were looking for simple yet mentally challenging games.<br/>
