#### About the game
We live in a world flooded with digital gadgets and most of them support video games, Hundreds of video games are released each year but there are very few games that pass the test of time.
Snake Game is one among the video games that received wide popularity, probably far beyond the creators of this game expected.
It is very difficult to find someone who has never played this game because the variations of it are available on almost every electronic device.
When a player plays snake game, he is controlling a snake, which is crawling in a compound wall which is usually the screen's boundaries.
Some games possess obstacles inside the compound wall while the normal version does not have any obstacle in between.
There will be new cubes and bonus goodies placed at different parts of the playing area and the strategy is to eat all of these while ensuring a smooth movement by the snake.
The snake's movement should not be restricted by an obstacle or its own body. While starting to play the game, managing the movement of your snake is very easy but when your snake eat various stuff placed on the screen, the snakes becomes bigger and navigation of the snake is very difficult.
There are different levels and when a player enters to a higher level, the snake's movement becomes faster which brings further difficulties to navigate it.
With experience and proper gaming strategies, players can "feed" their snakes to a very large extent and the snake's body will cover more than half of the entire screen.
However, this game demands a lot of skill, especially decision making capabilities. A successful player of snake game is the one who can make the right decisions and implement it within fraction of seconds. <br/>


#### History of the game?
The game evolved during the mid of 1970's and was widely played as an arcade game. Due to its simple graphics and easy interface, this game attracted both entry level and professional game players because the game catered the needs of players with various skill levels.
The main interesting feature of the game is that the snake is always on the move once the game is started. The player can only control the movement of the snake but can't stop it from moving.
Due to this fact, a player needed to pay constant attention throughout the game which brought the game more popularity. Once the popularity increased, Trefonas, a US manufacturer of microcomputer games introduced a microcomputer version of snake during 1978.
The game was played on a microcomputer called TRS-80 and received a warm welcome among game enthusiasts who were looking for simple yet mentally challenging games.<br/>
